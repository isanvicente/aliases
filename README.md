# aliases
Aliases used in linux shell. 
Working with bash. If you adapt this to other shells please do a pull request!

## Using the aliases
If you want it synchronized across machines, clone the repo in the new machine and add the following lines to your $HOME/.bashrc, before loading the .bash_aliases file. 
 **NOTE:** if you have a custom .bash_aliases file this will overwrite it!**

```
cd ~/aliases
git pull -q
cp .bash_aliases ~/
```
