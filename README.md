# aliases
Aliases used in linux shell. 
Working with bash. If you adapt this to other shells please do a pull request!


# if you want it synchronized across machines, clone the repo in the new machine and add this lines to your $HOME/.bashrc file, before loading the .bash_aliases file. 
# NOTE: if you had a custom .bash_aliases file this will overwrite it!
